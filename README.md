# Emotional Touch
A prototype application aimed at helping Asperger people recognize facial expressions during one-on-one conversations with the aid of computer vision algorithms.

## Purpose
People with Asperger's syndrome often have trouble communicating in an extensive manner as it is difficult for them to understand emotions portrayed by different facial expressions. The Emotional Touch Assistant is a mobile application used to record the fellow individual that is engaging in a conversation with the Asperger patient. Based on the machine learning model implemented with computer vision, it is able to detect and label the individual's facial expressions.
